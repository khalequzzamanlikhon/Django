    "SO if we push the responsibility of generating web pages to the client, the server essentially become a gateway to t he data. At the server we can provide endpoints that  the client can talk to, to get or save various pieces of data. For example, we  provide one end point to get  the list of proudcts , other for order list and so on. All the endpoints together represent the interface that the client use to talk to the server. In technical terms we say that the server provides an API (applicaiton interface programming). So our focus is to build an API using django"
